# Crypto-Price-Tracker

Coinbase doesn't provide a comprehensive overall profit calculation.
They didn't offer any +/- value until one of the more recent updates.

I wanted to have a way of visualizing all of the cryptos I owned and the individual profit on each.

This script uses coingecko's api to get all of the current values for each of the cryptos I hold.
The total and cost values in the "originalHoldings" dictionary must be changed for any individuals specific holdings as I removed my personal numbers.
More cryptos can be added by adding more ids to the coingecko link and to the dictionary mentioned above.
